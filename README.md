# tmblr-lab-codepath

### Version 1

## Overview
In this lab, you'll build the first part of an app that will allow users to view Tumblr posts. You'll work in collaborative pairs--Pair Programming--to apply the skills you've learned so far building your Flix App Assignment. Just like the Flix App, you'll create a network request to fetch data from the web, however instead of movies, you'll be getting blog post data from the Tumblr API.
