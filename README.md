# tmblr-lab-codepath

### Version 1

## Overview
In this lab, you'll build the first part of an app that will allow users to view Tumblr posts. You'll work in collaborative pairs--Pair Programming--to apply the skills you've learned so far building your Flix App Assignment. Just like the Flix App, you'll create a network request to fetch data from the web, however instead of movies, you'll be getting blog post data from the Tumblr API.

### Plan of attack
1. Get a list of tumblr post images--not including the captions(will implement later)
2. Display each image from the posts in a way that scrolls up and down to see all movies.
### Bonus User stories
- [X] User can view the app on various sizes and orientation
- [X] Run your app on a real device

### Version 2
- [] Removing tableview and using collectionview(better UI IMO)
- [] Finding appropriate font scale/size

### Version 2.1
- [] Passing data to another view controller
- [] Showing user post captions
- [] Going back to previouse view
